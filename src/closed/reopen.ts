 * The only rule that decides how a closed conversation comes back. Twin of
 * `focusPlan`, and it follows the same discipline: an absent or invalid origin
 * NEVER falls back to a guessed command — reopening something the user did not
 * ask for is worse than explaining that we cannot.
 *
 * `origin` is not typed `Origin`: the remote path — the window consuming a
 * request written by another one — has only what an untrusted JSON file
 * carried, not a `ClosedEntry`.
 *
 * The session id reaches a command line in the terminal branch. It is safe
 * because every id has passed `isValidSessionId` twice: once at the spool
 * boundary, once when `closed.json` was read back.

 * were pulled out of extension.ts's onVisible/focusSession — see
 * `focus/acknowledge.ts`'s header comment: a composition point living
 * directly in extension.ts has no automated coverage, and a reviewer has
 * already proven by mutation, on this exact codebase, that a broken call
 * site can compile and stay green while only the pure primitive underneath
 * (here, `reopenPlan`) is tested.
 *
 * `requestReopen` is injected rather than importing `FocusBroker` directly —
 * the same shape as `checkHooksInstalled`/`onDrop` on `SessionsTree`, or the
 * `archive` callback on `SpoolWatcher`: this function does not need to know
 * HOW a `command`-kind plan reaches another window, only that something
 * does, so a test can drive it without constructing a broker.
 *
 * The `terminal` case is handled HERE, not delegated to `requestReopen`:
 * `FocusBroker.requestReopen` deliberately does nothing for it — the caller
 * opens the terminal locally, before `requestReopen` is even invoked.
